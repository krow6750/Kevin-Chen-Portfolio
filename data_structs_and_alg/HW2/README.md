# Homework 2 

This is the starting readme for this assignment.  Please edit the following 
information by removing the "*edit me*" and replace it with appropriate 
information your assignment. If it is asking you a question, please provide 
a response.

- Name: Kevin Chen
- Title: Homework 2
- How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? ~8 hours
- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us 
  who and in what capacity.
  - Yes, I asked my friend Adrian DeCola for some help with git. Halfway though doing this assignment, I switched from using vim to VScode, and pushing from both editors caused some merging issues that took me a long time to figure out. I eventually had to delete and remake the entire CS5008_kevinchen repository, so I had a zoom call with Will to make sure that the TAs could still see and run my work on their side.
- Did you use any external resources? (Cite them below)
  - w3schools.com
  - stack overflow
  - docs.github.com
- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 
  - I really enjoyed using the queue_test as a separate test file to make sure everything in my header was working well. Same case scenario for stack_test as well.
- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 
  - I would add soome more pointers on how to handle merge conflicts when using git, though in my case it was just a huge error on my side to push a half completed assignment when I was using vim, then redoing the entire assignment on vscode and pushing again. Now that I've figured it out and cleared up the confusion I won't have this problem again.

### Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the 
servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.northeastern.edu` to complete 
and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are 
compiled strictly for our machine's architecture, and this is a consistent 
architecture where your submission will be graded.

### Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. 
  Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we 
  grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files (if any) into your repository so we 
  can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget to push your changes to your repo before the assignment 
  deadline!*

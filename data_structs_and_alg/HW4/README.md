## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the 
servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.northeastern.edu` to complete 
and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are 
compiled strictly for our machine's architecture, and this is a consistent 
architecture where your submission will be graded.

## Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. 
  Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we 
  grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files (if any) into your repository so we 
  can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget to push your changes in your repo to GitHub before the 
  assignment deadline!

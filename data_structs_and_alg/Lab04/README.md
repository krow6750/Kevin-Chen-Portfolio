# Lab 4 - Sorting

This is the starting readme for this assignment.  Please edit the following 
information by removing the "*edit me*" and replace it with appropriate 
information your assignment. If it is asking you a question, please provide 
a response.

- Name: Kevin Chen

- Description: Lab04 Sorting Algorithms

- How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? 5 Hours

- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell 
  us who and in what capacity.
  - I clarified with Nick if it was fine that only Csort is the only sorting algorithm that returned an output above input values of 1000000, and he let me know the overall purpose of the exercise is to show how these sort algorithms work differently when implemented. Thus, I adjusted my google sheets chart to exclude some cells that were significantly larger in input size and/or sort time in seconds.

## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the 
servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.northeastern.edu` to complete 
and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are 
compiled strictly for our machine's architecture, and this is a consistent 
architecture where your submission will be graded.

## Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. 
  Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we 
  grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files (if any) into your repository so we 
  can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget to push your changes in your repo to GitHub before the 
  assignment deadline!

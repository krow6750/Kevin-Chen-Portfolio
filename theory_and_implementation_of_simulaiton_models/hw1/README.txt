#8: Becuase each roll of the dice results in a different sum, we will see different histogram curves with each run through/simulation. There are only 10 rolls for this simulation, so we won't really see a normal histogram curve. However, if we increase the number of rolls to 100 or even more, we effectively increase the sample size and would achieve an average (as marked by the blue line) of 0.125. The result of the dice rolled will become more streamlined, as in lower standard deviations and closer to the calculated mean with each extra simulated roll. Quantiles will also decrease, as the 50% quantile approaches 0.125.

#9: Between the first and second experiment, we change the number of simulated dice rolls. What I can notice is that the bottom left histogram shows a more standardized/expected curve, becoming more so as each simulation is run. The first row experiences a less extreme change, however, with a higher change in mean and standard deviation.
